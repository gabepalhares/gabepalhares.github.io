          <strong>This is a <a href="https://nownownow.com/" target="_blank" class="underline">now</a> page,</strong> inspired by Derek Sivers and the <a href="https://sive.rs/nowff" target="_blank" class="underline">now page movement</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
          <strong>I love the concept of a now page.</strong> It helps a lot and it <strong>just works</strong>. A now page allows me to share what I'm currently focused on without the need for real-time updates. It's the pure essence of remote and asynchronous communication.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
          <strong>For me,</strong> it's also a helpful reminder when I'm feeling unfocused. A now page serves as a public commitment to my priorities and a reminder to stay on track. I'll likely update this page once a month to reflect any changes in my focus or goals.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
          <strong>If you're curious</strong> and want to talk about anything, just send me an email or reach me at <a href="https://x.com/minortypo" target="_blank" class="underline">X</a>. I'll enjoy chatting with you.

        <strong>Since childhood,</strong> I’ve been very active, enjoying various sports and competitions. I even used to play outside with neighbors until night and, weirdly, was also a bit of a nerd, excelling in my studies and having different hobbies.
      </p>
      <p class='mb-3'>
        <strong>Today,</strong> sports remain essential to me. I run, lift weights, mountain bike, and play football occasionally. Unironically, I’m still a <strong>nerd at heart</strong>, enjoying sci-fi, computer games, and exploring topics in science, astronomy, and technology.
