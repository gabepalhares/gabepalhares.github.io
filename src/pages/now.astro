          <strong>This is a <a href="https://nownownow.com/" target="_blank" class="underline">now</a> page,</strong> inspired by Derek Sivers and the <a href="https://sive.rs/nowff" target="_blank" class="underline">now page movement</a>.

        <p class="mb-3">
          <strong>I love the concept of a now page.</strong> It helps a lot and it <strong>just works</strong>. A now page allows me to share what I'm currently focused on without the need for real-time updates. It's the pure essence of remote and asynchronous communication.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
          <strong>For me,</strong> it's also a helpful reminder when I'm feeling unfocused. A now page serves as a public commitment to my priorities and a reminder to stay on track. I'll likely update this page once a month to reflect any changes in my focus or goals.
        </p>

        <strong>I consider myself</strong> a simple person, and to be honest, I don't need much to be happy.
        To enjoy my time and take care of myself, I run, lift weights, mountain bike, and play football. But Iâ€™m also a <strong>nerd</strong> at heart, enjoying sci-fi, computer games, and exploring topics in science, astronomy, and technology.
