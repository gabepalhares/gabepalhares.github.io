              <p class="mb-3">
                <strong>Hi, my name is Gabriel,</strong> also known as <strong>Palhares</strong>.
                I'm a full-stack web developer and a lifelong computer science student.
                I enjoy what I do, and I love getting better at what I do.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-3">
                <strong>I work on providing solutions</strong> both in front-end and back-end development, using technologies like TypeScript, React, Node, and Go.
                I also have practical knowledge with relational and non-relational databases, such as PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-3"><strong>My academic journey</strong> began with a Bachelor's in <strong>Law</strong>, which I completed in late 2023.
                After deciding to make a career transition to Computer Science, I am now pursuing a degree in <strong>Systems Analysis and Development</strong> at the Catholic University of Minas Gerais (PUC Minas), with graduation set for June 2025.
                Additionally, I completed an extension program in <strong>Modern Software Engineering</strong> at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG).
              </p>
              <p class="mb-3">
                <strong>When I'm not coding,</strong> you'll find me enjoying mountain biking and living an outdoor lifestyle.
                I love practicing sports and doing things that connect me with nature, like hiking and camping. I think everyone needs this kind of experience since it works like a 'reset button', allowing you to recharge and return to being your best self.

                  <strong>I believe every software engineer</strong> should have the curiosity, courage, and flexibility to use different programming languages and tech stacks in specific scenarios and contexts, with the main requirement being 'what's best for the problem you're solving'. That being said, I know I'll probably never be great at everything, but I'll always be open to and interested in learning new things and solving problems in more than one way.

            <p class="mb-3"><strong>I was born in Brazil,</strong> so my native language is Brazilian Portuguese. Since childhood, I've had the desire to learn other languages and explore new cultures. It was a thought like: 'What's it like up there? I want to discover'.</p>
            <p class="mb-3"><strong>During my teenage years,</strong> I had the opportunity to study English as a Second Language (ESL) at the CCAA English School. From that point on, I started consuming all sorts of content in English - books, movies, music - and over time, I became very proficient in English.</p>
            <p><strong>Recently,</strong> I've developed a strong passion for Brazil's neighboring countries, which has driven me to learn Spanish and travel to other South American countries, such as Argentina, Chile, Peru, and Paraguay.</p>
